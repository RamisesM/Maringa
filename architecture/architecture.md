### Software Architecture

#### Questions to be raised

- How will the users be using the application?
- How will the application be deployed into production and managed?
- What are the quality attribute requirements for the application, such as
security, performance, concurrency, internationalization, and configuration?
- How can the application be designed to be flexible and maintainable over time?
- What are the architectural trends that might impact your application now or a
after it has been deployed?

#### Goals

- Expose the structure of the system but hide the implementation details.
- Realize all of the use cases and scenarios.
- Try to address the requirements of various stakeholders.
- Handle both functional and quality requirements.

#### Trends

- User empowerment.
- Market maturity. - Many problems are already solved.
- Flexible design. - Modularity, plugability.
- Future trends.

#### Principles

- Build to change instead of building to last.
- Model to analyze and reduce risk.
- Use models and visualizations as a communication and collaboration tool.
- Identify key engineering decisions.
