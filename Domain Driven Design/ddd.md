### DDD

It is similar to SAT's ideal: modularization, separate by roles, top-down dev

Premise:

- Placing the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic
- Basing complex designs on a model of the domain
- Initiating a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to
iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems

Common terms:

- Context: The setting in which a word or statement appears that determines its
meaning. Statements about a model can only be understood in a context.
- Model: A system of abstractions that describes selected aspects of a domain
and can be used to solve problems related to that domain.
- Ubiquitous Language: A language structured around the domain model and used by
all team members to connect all the activities of the team with the software.
- Bounded Context: A description of a boundary (typically a subsystem, or the
work of a specific team) within which a particular model is defined and
applicable.
