### DDD

It is similar to SAT's ideal: modularization, separate by roles, top-down dev

Premise:

- Placing the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic
- Basing complex designs on a model of the domain
- Initiating a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to
iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems
