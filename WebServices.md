Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and Representational State Transfer (REST) are two answers to the same question: how to access Web services.

# REST

Requests can be made by urls, example:

https://www.googleapis.com/gmail/v1/users/me/messages?q=%22in:sent%20after:2014/01/01%20before:2014/01/30%22

HTTP is required as basic methods are used like POST and GET.

`
GET http://api.wunderground.com/api/Your_Key/conditions/q/CA/San_Francisco.json
`
