#### MD5

The MD5 algorithm is a widely used hash function producing a 128-bit hash value.
Although MD5 was initially designed to be used as a cryptographic hash function,
it has been found to suffer from extensive vulnerabilities. It can still be used
as a checksum to verify data integrity, but only against unintentional
corruption.
